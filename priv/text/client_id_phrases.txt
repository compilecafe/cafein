sleep is for the weak caffeine is for the geeks
code now coffee later
just one more cup I swear
caffeine levels dangerously high
coffee makes bugs disappear sometimes
never too much caffeine right
is this a bug or a coffee stain
SSO super shot of espresso
logging in but first coffee
too much caffeine not enough semicolons
born to debug fueled by cafein
real devs use coffee as RAM
sip compile repeat
wake code caffeinate repeat
zero caffeine zero commits
error no caffeine detected
caffeine driven development
coffee before deploy always
keyboard runs on coffee
my IDE needs more coffee
you had me at coffee
commit messages powered by cafein
git push then sip
deploy now panic later
auto login powered by cafein
stay calm and drink cafein
caffeine helps me pass tests
caffeine is my copilot
keep calm and trust the beans
no bugs just beans
cafein mode activated
I came I coded I caffeinated
